FoodBites are here to reduce food wastage in Singapore. In 2016, Singapore had generated a total of 791,000 tonnes of food waste. Out of that, only 14% of it gets recycled. This means that 86% of the remaining gets burnt/dumped into landfills. 

## How are we going to do it?
FoodBites aim to reduce food wastage by connecting food stall owners like bakeries, restaurants or even old chang kee to consumers through an mobile application. Through the applications, shop owners are able to post and notify the consumers that are subscribed to their stall that there are going to close for the evening and there are still food available at a discounted price. 

This is a win-win situation for both the consumers and the shop owners. For the shop owners, they are able to generate more profits by selling away all their food items. For consumers, they are able to purchase their favourite food items at a discounted rate! 

## What are our inspirations? 
We have seen mobiles apps from other countries like [OLIO](https://olioex.com/), [Food for all](https://foodforall.com/), [treatsure](https://www.treatsure.co/), and [Food rescue US](https://foodrescue.us/).

## What features are there? 
**Shop Owner App**
1) Basic CRUD - shop owners to post food 
2) Automatic Post expiration - shop owners post will eventually get automatically removed after certain hours.
3) Email Login 

**Consumer App**

2) Showing nearby food outlets - consumers can search and find based on proximity 
3) Google Login for consumers 
4) Ability to follow different shop outlets
